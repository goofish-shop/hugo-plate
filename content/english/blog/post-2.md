##  Introduction


I was a dance and secondary education major with a minor in musical theater performance at Bridgewater State University in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. I also earned my MA Teaching License in dance for grades K-12 so that I can teach dance in the MA public school system. My time as an undergraduate dance major was rigorous and creatively and academically and artistically challenging. This portfolio showcases the wide variety of work I did during my time at BSU.


## Research


*Advanced Individual Project- Choreographing the High School Musical:*
*Teaching Methods for Teaching Choreography to a High School Theatre Company*

This was the most extensive research project I conducted while at BSU. For this project, I worked with a high school theater company on their spring musical, The Addams Family. Before choreographing for this company, I researched various teaching methods and strategies and created an annotated bibliography with the techniques I planned to use while teaching these dances to my students. Before each rehearsal, I created a lesson plan using these methods. After each rehearsal, I reflected on the strategies used and evaluate them based on their effectiveness.

After all of the rehearsals were complete, I created a second annotated bibliography including the evaluations of the teaching strategies. From there, I created an online portfolio showcasing the most effective practices. I presented this research as a poster presentation at the National Dance Education Organization's 2018 National Conference in San Diego, California, and shared my findings with other dance educators that work with similar populations.

*Dance Methodology- The Pressure to Bend:*

*â€‹The Mental and Physical Effects of Pressure from Dance Educators to be Flexible on Adolescent and Teenage Students*

During the course Dance Methodology. I dove into my passion for ableism in dance and researched the pressure for adolescent and teenage students to be physically flexible. This research was inspired by my own experience in dance, as I have a genetic condition that makes the tendons in my lower extremities significantly shorter than the average person's, thus making me less flexible than the other dancers in my classes. I experienced this pressure to bend and I found many similarities to my experience through my research. I found that this pressure can be harmful to dancers both physically and mentally.

I created an annotated bibliography for this project and presented my work at a poster presentation for the Mid-Year Symposium at Bridgewater State University.

## Dance Educator Preparation

Not only am I a double major in dance and secondary education, but I took many courses specially geared towards dance education. During the courses Creative Dance for Children, Dance Methodology, and Ballet Pedagogy, I learned skills for dance educators including effective teaching strategies, developmental psychology, and classroom management. I created a variety of lesson plans throughout these courses as well as co-taught a lesson with my peers at a middle school in Brockton, MA.

Through the education department, I am becoming SEI (Sheltered English Immersion) endorsed and earning my MA Teaching License in dance for grades K-12. I will be student teaching at the Sage School in Foxborough, MA during the spring of 2019.

*Creative Dance for Children- Creative Dance Classes in Public Schools May Have a Positive Impact on Teenagers that Self-Harm*

The first research project I worked on during my time at BSU was in the course Creative Dance for Children. I was interested in finding a benefit and rationale for providing creative dance education in public schools where self-harm is a growing problem amongst teenagers. 

I created an annotated bibliography for this project and presented it to my class at the end of the semester.

## Dance Performance

I had the opportunity to perform in mainstage and other productions at BSU in a variety of styles including ballet, modern/contemporary, swing, jazz, and Scottish Highland Dance with the Department of Dance as well as the BSU Dance Company. These performance opportunities helped me to grow as a dancer and learn new styles as well as gain an appreciation for cultural dance forms.


## Choreography


I have had many opportunities to choreograph during my time as an undergraduate student. At BSU, I took Dance Composition and Dance Production Theory with Dr. Jody Weber. In these classes, I learned about choreographic elements and how to convey meaning through movement.

My first staged ballet piece premiered in Bridgewater State University in the Dance Department's annual production of Winterdance in 2016. My piece, "Barefoot", tells the story of a young girl who has a magical pair of ballet slippers that are stolen overnight by an evil figure in her life. Throughout the dance, the ballerina learns to overcome the loss of her shoes and finds the strength to dance barefoot. During this production, I worked with a variety of dancers at different levels of ballet technique (from beginner to advanced).


I was also a student choreographer for BSU Department of Dance's Dance Kaleidoscope 2019. My piece, "We the People", featured a range of dancers at different levels dancing in ballet, jazz, and contemporary techniques. I created the original score using audio clips from Youtube videos and news broadcasts as well as voice recordings and instrumental music. The piece is a political statement about the divide that the two party system in the U.S. has created for our country.

While watching the piece, ask yourself...
What is the purpose of political parties if all they have done is divide us?
Where is the productivity when white noise echoes from Capital Hill?
What progress would be made if we met each other half way and celebrated our similarities?



Outside of BSU, I served as a choreographer for both Presentation of Mary Academy (PMA) and Amesbury Children's Theatre (ACT)  for their musical theatre productions of The Addams Family (PMA), Just So (PMA), and James and the Giant Peach Jr. (ACT). With PMA, I worked with high school students with a variety of skill levels. ACT's production of James primarily featured elementary school children with different dance experiences. I taught basic dance concepts to these students as well as staged ACT's very first tap number.



## Musical Theater


Besides working with local theatre companies, I was very involved with the Department of Theater during my time at BSU. I enrolled in the musical theater performance minor and took additional courses in dance, acting, music, and more. I expanded on my performance skills by taking voice lessons, I learned more about choreographing for musicals by working with Professor Larry Sousa, and I was cast in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying during the Fall of 2018.

In addition to performance, I served as the Stage Manager for Dance Kaleidoscope 2018 and was in responsible for organizing rehearsals, communicating information to cast and crew members, and calling all sound and lighting cues for the show. I also worked in the BSU Box Office from September-December 2018.

## Community Outreach



During my freshman and sophomore years at BSU, I was a member of the Classical Ballet in the Community Service Learning course. As a member of this group, I learned a variety of classical ballet pieces and performed them in local nursing homes for those who are unable to go see a performance on their own. I was cast as Clara in excerpts from The Nutcracker in our 2016 and 2017 repertoire, as well as the Lilac Fairy in excerpts from The Sleeping Beauty in 2017. In addition to taking on leading roles, I served as our company manager in 2017. I was responsible for organizing rehearsals, booking performances, and arranging transportation for the group. 

On top of expanding my ballet repertoire, this course gave me the opportunity to give back to the community and share my love for ballet with those in need. The staff of the nursing homes requested that this group return year after year and I found it fulfilling to give back to these residents by performing for them.


## Involvement with NDEO

The National Dance Education Organization (NDEO) is a nation-wide nonprofit organization that promotes dance education and artistry. BSU has its very own chapter of NDEO (known as the NDEO Student Organization, or NSO for short), which I became a part of during my sophomore year. I have been an active member of NSO for three years as well as the national organization.

My involvements with the organization include:

* Attending weekly NSO meetings to discuss curriculum reform, recruitment events, and other opportunities to promote dance education at BSU
* Serving as the Secretary of NSO for the 2018-2019 school year and being responsible for writing monthly newsletters, updating our website, keeping track of weekly minutes and attendance, and other executive board responsibilities
* Being inducted into the National Honor Society for Dance Arts (NHSDA)
* Attending the 2018 NDEO Conference in San Diego, California, and presenting my research during a poster presentation
* Teaching a musical theatre dance class for NSO's weekly "Combo Classes"
* Having two articles published by NDEO: "Audition Advice", featured in NHSDA's Newsletter and "Teaching is a Vocation, Not a Fallback" on NDEO's Behind the Curtain Blog
